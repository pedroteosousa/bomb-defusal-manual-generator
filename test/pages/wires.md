## On the Subject of Wires
> Wires are the lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the lifeblood.
> Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No matterâ€¦

- A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it.
- Only the one correct wire needs to be cut to disarm the
module.
- Wire ordering begins with the first on the top.
