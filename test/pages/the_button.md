### Releasing a Held Button

If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the module. Based on its color you must release the button at a specific point in time:

- _Blue strip:_ release when the countdown timer has a 4 in any position.
- _White strip:_ release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.
- _Yellow strip:_ release when the countdown timer has a 5 in any position.
Any other color strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any
position.
